    <h1>Git Quiz</h1>
        <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
        <p>Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.</p>
        <h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
        <p>Branches give you the freedom to independently work on different modules (not necessarily though) and merge the modules when you finish developing them. It might sound a cumbersome process, but git branches are swift to be created and destroyed.</p>
        <h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
        <p>The working tree, or working directory, consists of files that you are currently working on. You can think of a working tree as a file system where you can view and modify files. The index, or staging area, is where commits are prepared. The index compares the files in the working tree to the files in the repo.</p>
        <h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
        <p>These files are also referred to as "untracked files." Staging area is files that are going to be a part of the next commit, which lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur for the next commit. The repository contains all of a project's commits.</p>
        <h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
        <p>git fetch</p>
